# Sample of Price Decryption

- The settlement price obtained by the DSP is the encrypted settlement price. Each DSP has a unique settlement price decryption key and is kept in a safe place.

- Decryption code please refer to `https://developers.google.cn/authorized-buyers/rtb/response-guide/decrypt-price?hl=zh-CN`
