# STEPS OF INTEGRATION

1. Developed according to integration agreement

    Starting development based on [rtb protocol](rtb_protocol.md), combined with [sample of bidding ad request and response](sample_of_request_and_response.md). After development, please contact the technical staff of the AdVlion ADX platform to assist with the test.

2. Get the price decryption key

    Contacting the technician of AdVlion ADX for `e_key` and `i_key`.

4. Online test

    Contacting operator to test with a little online inventory in AdVlion ADX. The AdVlion ADX platform sends a portion of the online inventory to the DSP, and the DSP can be purchased normally. Please make sure the statistics data (including ad requests, impressions, clicks and so on) is correct.

5. Deploy the integration

   After the DSP and AdVlion ADX operators communicate the required Ad slot type and online inventory magnitude, they begin to send online inventory.
